Landing Page with Changeable Background
<br><br>
Project Description:<br>
The Landing Page with Changeable Background is a dynamic web application that allows users to interact with a visually appealing landing page where they can change the background image in real time. The project aims to enhance user experience by offering customization features, making the landing page more engaging and personalized.
<br><br>
Key Features:<br>
1. Interactive Buttons for Background Change:<br>
   - The page includes buttons that allow users to switch between multiple pre-set background images with a simple click. Each button triggers a background change, providing a variety of visual aesthetics for the user to choose from.<br><br>

2. One-Time Message Display:<br>
   - On the initial visit, a one-time overlay message appears, instructing users on how to interact with the page. This message disappears once the user clicks the "Ok" button and will not show up again during the same session.<br><br>

3. Responsive Design:<br>
   - The landing page is fully responsive, ensuring that the layout and background images adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.<br><br>

4. Customizable Background Options:<br><br>
   - Users can cycle through a range of background images using left and right arrow buttons. The background changes instantly, giving users the flexibility to personalize the look of the page to their preference.<br><br>

5. Smooth Transitions and Hover Effects:<br>
   - The background changes and button interactions come with smooth transitions, giving the page a polished and professional feel. The buttons are designed with hover effects for better visual feedback during interaction.<br>
<br>
Technologies Used:<br>
- HTML5: To create the structure of the landing page and include elements like buttons and text.<br>
- CSS3: For styling the layout, adding hover effects, and ensuring responsiveness across devices.<br>
- JavaScript: To handle the logic for background changes, manage the one-time message display, and create a seamless user experience.<br><br>

How It Works:<br>
- When a user first visits the landing page, a black notification box with white text appears, explaining that the user can change the background using the provided buttons.<br>
- Once the user clicks "Ok," the message disappears, and the user can interact with the "change background" buttons.<br>
- Clicking the left or right buttons will change the background image to different predefined visuals, giving the page a fresh look based on the user’s choice.<br><br>

Purpose:<br>
This project is perfect for websites that want to offer a personalized experience to visitors or create a landing page with user interaction. It’s ideal for personal portfolios, product pages, or interactive landing pages that seek to engage users visually.
